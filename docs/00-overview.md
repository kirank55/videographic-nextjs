# Videographic - Project Overview

## 🎬 What is Videographic?

Videographic is a **web-based AI-powered video editor** that allows users to:

1. **Describe a video in natural language** → The AI generates a complete video timeline
2. **Edit the video visually** → Using a canvas-based editor with timeline controls
3. **Export to MP4/WebM** → Render the final video using modern browser APIs

Think of it as "Canva meets AI for video creation" - you describe what you want, and the system creates it.

## 🏗️ How It Works (High-Level)

    A[User Prompt] --> B[AI Generation]
    B --> C[VideoProject JSON]
    C --> D[Editor Store]
    D --> E[Canvas Display]

```

### The Three Main Flows

| Flow | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AI Generation** | User writes a prompt → AI returns valid JSON → Stored as VideoProject |
| **Editing** | User interacts with Canvas/Timeline → Changes update the store → UI re-renders |
| **Export** | Store data → Rendered frame-by-frame → Encoded as video file |

## 📖 Glossary of Key Terms

Before diving deeper, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **VideoProject** | The main data structure containing all video settings and elements |
| **TimelineEvent** | A single element in the video (text, shape, image, audio, etc.) |
| **Canvas** | The visual editing area powered by Fabric.js where elements are rendered |
| **Timeline** | The horizontal track view showing when elements appear/disappear |
| **Animation** | Property changes over time (opacity, position, scale, rotation) |
| **Transition** | Visual effects when elements enter/exit (fade, slide, scale) |
| **Layer** | Z-index ordering - higher layers appear in front |
| **GSAP** | GreenSock Animation Platform - the animation engine used |
| **Fabric.js** | HTML5 canvas library for object-based drawing and interactions |
| **Zustand** | Lightweight state management library for React |
| **WebCodecs** | Browser API for encoding video frames (Chrome) |
| **MediaRecorder** | Browser API for recording canvas (Firefox fallback) |

## 📁 Key Files to Explore

Start with these files to understand the core:

| File | Why It's Important |
|------|-------------------|
| `src/stores/editor-store.ts` | The heart of state management |
| `src/lib/schemas/timeline.ts` | All data structure definitions |
| `src/lib/core/FabricRenderer.ts` | Renders data to canvas |
| `src/lib/ai/prompts.ts` | AI system prompt and validation |
| `src/components/editor/EditorClient.tsx` | Main editor component |

## ❓ Common Questions

### "Where does the video data live?"
→ In the Zustand store (`editor-store.ts`) during editing, and in PostgreSQL (via Prisma) for persistence.

### "How does AI know what to generate?"
→ A carefully crafted system prompt in `prompts.ts` tells the AI exactly what JSON structure to output.

### "How are animations rendered?"
→ GSAP interpolates property values, and `FabricRenderer` applies them to Fabric.js objects each frame.

### "What browsers are supported?"
→ Chrome (WebCodecs for export) and Firefox (MediaRecorder fallback). Safari has limited support.
